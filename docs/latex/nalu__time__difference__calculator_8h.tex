\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class computes time differences based on the clock cycles of the board. It also checks if the time difference is within a specified threshold, taking into account a maximum trigger time and its half value to handle wraparounds in the clock cycle counts. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
